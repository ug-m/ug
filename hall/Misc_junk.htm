The task of creatinga production plot was fairly time consuming when you consider that youhad to fill the pens were first clean, then fill them with ink, make surethat they were free flowing and then load the pens and start the plot beforethe pens dry out.&nbsp; Then afterwards, if there was not going to be anymore plots created, the pens has to be cleaned, which required that theybe disassembled, cleaned, dried, reassembled and then stored where theywould not get dirty.&nbsp; If there was going to be more plots createdsoon, you would need to remove the pens and place them somewhere wherethey would not dry out (<i><a href="Pen_article_1.htm">click here</a></i>for an article on the trials and tribulations of pen plotting).&nbsp; Manypeople used small sealed containers with a wet sponge where the tips ofthe pen could be kept moist between plots.&nbsp; This was the standarduntil the introduction of electrostatic plotters and the eventual movetoward laser printers and ink jet technology.</font></b><br><hr WIDTH="100%"><center><a NAME="Punch-reader"></a><br><b><font size=+2>Paper Tape Punch/Reader</font></b><br><img SRC="Papertape_punch.jpg" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=507 width=504 align=BOTTOM></center><p><b><font size=+1>This is a paper tape punch/reader used to output punchedtape for NC machines.&nbsp;
