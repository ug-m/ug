Even though the PFK is not supported by today's versionof Unigraphics (and has not been since the release of V10.0) this exhibitshould be of interest to many people since the PFK was a symbol of theproduct for years.&nbsp; Note that Unigraphics was not the only CAD applicationthat used a PFK.&nbsp; At one time or another the following product allsupported a PFK in one form or another:&nbsp; Catia, CADAM, CADD, NCAD,Gerber, etc.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>That being said, exactly what is a PFK.&nbsp; As thename implies, the Programmed Function Keyboard was used to select variousfunctions by selecting a key on a special keyboard.&nbsp; There were 32<i><a href="Misc_junk.htm#PFK_bulb">back-lightedbuttons</a></i>, with 14 buttons numbered and the remainder labeled withspecific functions.&nbsp; This was in fact the entire user interface forearly version of Unigraphics (pre-V10.0).&nbsp; What a user did was sitin front of a Unigraphics workstation and displayed on the message monitor(and later in a sub window of the main graphics screen) was a list of upto 14 options that the user could select by pushing on the 14 numberedbuttons (the ones that were available for selection were lighted).&nbsp;Many of the non-numbered buttons we also available and when so, they werealso lit.&nbsp; Those items that were on all of the time were called "SpecialFunctions" and that approach is still used today in that these are themenu or toolbar items that are available when inside of an applicationsuch as Layer Control, Views &amp; Layouts, Info, Blank/UnBlank, etc.&nbsp;Later on in this section there will be a review of the functions and whatthe menus look like for performing an example of a typical task in Unigraphics.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>The photo's below will follow the history of the PFKas it evolved over the years.&nbsp; As stated before, the PFK was the mainfeature of the User Interface of Unigraphics until the release of V10.0(note that once the first Unix window based system was implemented, thePFK, while still supported, was optional as there was also support forselecting menu options using standard keyboard function keys and the numericalkeypad was mapped to provide the equivalent of the 14 numbered keys).</font></b></blockquote><hr WIDTH="100%"><center><a NAME="PFK_Overlays"></a><br><b><font size=+2>PFK Overlay Templates for UG0, UGI and UGII</font></b><br><a href="UG0_PFK_Layout.htm"><img SRC="UG0_PFK_Small.jpg" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=216 width=250 align=BOTTOM></a>-&nbsp;<a href="UGI_PFK_Layout.htm"><img SRC="UGI_PFK_Small.jpg" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=216 width=249 align=BOTTOM></a>-&nbsp;<a href="UGII_PFK_Layout.htm"><img SRC="UGII_PFK_Small.jpg" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=216 width=249 align=BOTTOM></a></center><p><b><font size=+1>Shown above are scanned images of the plastic overlaytemplate used on the large upright type of PFK.&nbsp;

It was eventually replaced with asimilar configuration except that the metal case was replaced with a moremodern looking plastic housing.&nbsp; Also with this early version of thisstyle PFK, the section holding the joy-stick could be replaced with anoptional set of thumb wheels for those people that preferred them basedon their previous use of the Tektronix 4014 terminals.</font></b><center><p><img SRC="UG_PFK_Diagram.jpg" VSPACE=5 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=591 width=792></center><p><b><font size=+1>This is a diagram, from a Unigraphics Users Manual,of the new lower profile PFK as shown in the picture above.&nbsp;
