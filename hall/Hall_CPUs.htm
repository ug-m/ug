As a side note for those interested, there isa Pulitzer Prize winning book available ("The Soul of the New Machine",by Tracy Kidder, copyright 1981) that follows the history of the developmentof the MV8000, or as it was then code named, the "Eagle".</font></b><center><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><b><font size=+2>Data General MV4000 CPU</font></b><br><img SRC="DG_MV4000.jpg" VSPACE=10 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=360 width=307 align=BOTTOM></center><p><b><font size=+1>While the Data General MV4000 was sold as a small mainframethat could run 4 to 6 workstations, the most significant thing about thissystem was that it was the core of the last private-labled system manufacturedby McAuto, the M-250.&nbsp;
