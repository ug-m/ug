<font size=+4>The <b><i><font face="Palatino"><font color="#FF0000">Unigraphics
</font></font></i></b>Virtual
Museum.</font></h1></center>

<blockquote>
<h3>
Welcome!&nbsp; You have just entered the "Lobby" of our virtual museum.&nbsp;
Here you will learn about the history of Unigraphics and the people who
developed it.&nbsp; If you are not familiar with Unigraphics but would
like to learn more, <i><a href="what_is_ug.htm">please select here</a></i>.</h3>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h3>
Note that this is a virtual museum, however we have set it up just like
a real museum with several "Galleries" just off from the main "Lobby".&nbsp;
Each "Gallery" is dedicated to a different aspect of Unigraphics.&nbsp;
Some of these will review the history through the decades while others
will be reserved for various specialized topics.&nbsp; As you visit each
"Gallery" you will find information and many "artifacts" donated by various
<i><a href="friends_of_museum.htm">friends
of the museum</a></i>.&nbsp; At times you will notice that some of these
"artifacts" are from other products which may have had either a direct
or perhaps an indirect impact on the evolution of Unigraphics.&nbsp; These
are included here both for their historical value and because without them,
it may be difficult for many of you to understand the real history of Unigraphics.</h3>

<h3>
Now we invite you to browse through the various "Galleries" and we hope
that you will find the experience both entertaining and perhaps even enlightening.&nbsp;
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the museum curator.</h3>
