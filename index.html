<h1>The&nbsp;<strong><em>Unigraphics&nbsp;</em></strong>Virtual Museum.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome! You have just entered the &quot;Lobby&quot; of our virtual museum.&nbsp; Here you will learn about the history of Unigraphics and the people who developed it.&nbsp; If you are not familiar with Unigraphics but would like to learn more,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812014439/http://www.plmworld.org/index.php?mo=cm&amp;op=ld&amp;fid=218">please select here</a></em>.</p>

<p>Note that this is a virtual museum, however we have set it up just like a real museum with several &quot;Galleries&quot; just off from the main &quot;Lobby&quot;.&nbsp; Each &quot;Gallery&quot; is dedicated to a different aspect of Unigraphics.&nbsp; Some of these will review the history through the decades while others will be reserved for various specialized topics.&nbsp; As you visit each &quot;Gallery&quot; you will find information and many &quot;artifacts&quot; donated by various&nbsp;<em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812014439/http://www.plmworld.org/index.php?mo=cm&amp;op=ld&amp;fid=283">friends of the museum</a></em>.&nbsp; At times you will notice that some of these &quot;artifacts&quot; are from other products which may have had either a direct or perhaps an indirect impact on the evolution of Unigraphics.&nbsp; These are included here both for their historical value and because without them, it may be difficult for many of you to understand the real history of Unigraphics.</p>

<p>Now we invite you to browse through the various &quot;Galleries&quot; and we hope that you will find the experience both entertaining and perhaps even enlightening.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180812014439/mailto:beth@plmworld.org">museum curator</a>.</p>
