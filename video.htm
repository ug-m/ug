Note that this is what Unigraphics was like when I started to use it for the first time in 1977 when the company I was working for at time, Baker Perkins Inc (no relations) in Saginaw, Michigan, bought a three terminal system running on a Data General Eclipse S200 computer. We designed and manufactured chemical and food processing equipment for large commercial customers. At the time I was working as a Product Engineer in the Food Division, and was part of the first group of people sent by our company to Carson, California for UG training. Note that our sister company in the UK (Peterborough), Baker Perkins Ltd, was the first company to purchase a Unigraphics system outside of North America. We timed our week of training perfectly as the 2nd Annual UG Users Meeting was held the following week so we got to attend and meet many of the early adopters of Unigraphics.<br/><br/>Please note the hair styles. Also, the name of the film was a bit of marketing stretch when you consider how young the field of CAD/CAM was in 1978.<br/><br/>Note that in 1980, I left Baker Perkins, took my vested pension (which I started to collect when I turned 65) and moved my family to SoCal and went to work for McAuto, the Automation Division of McDonnell Douglas, which was the company developing and marketing Unigraphics, and took a job as a consultant in the sales department helping to sell and support Unigraphics.<br/></font></b></blockquote><br/><h1>Unigraphics: Doorway to Growth</h1><iframe width="640" height="480" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/shEXiKlf3Vg" title="Unigraphics:  Doorway to Growth" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><blockquote><b><font size=+1>Here's a newer marketing film, released in 1982, when the company was now fully integrated into the McAuto organization. In this case, we hired an actual Hollywood production company (the previous film was shot and produced in-house by the MDC production department) and an actor who had been in several TV shows and commercials (this guy was a real pro and we all learned a lot about how movies were made). I was one of the technical advisors (although I didn't get listed in the credits) for the film and worked side-by-side with the film crew. And if you watch really careful, you'll see the back of my head in a short scene shot in a classroom setting.<br/><br/>Now while the name of this film, which again was distributed to our sales offices as a 16mm film, was a bit more more subtle, it was still filled with stuff that was, at the time, very embryonic, but it did demonstrate that in just a few short years, Unigraphics had progressed a great deal. And one other thing, we often referred to this film as the 'Smoking Door' (you know I mean when you see the last scene).<br/></font></b></blockquote><br/><h1>Mission: Possible - Unigraphics at AUTOFACT 1990</h1><iframe width="640" height="480" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vIxVoCxy_DY" title="Mission: Possible - Unigraphics at AUTOFACT 1990" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><blockquote><b><font size=+1>Video produced for the Fall 1990 AUTOFACT Show in Detroit, MI.
