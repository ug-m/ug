PADL (Part andAssembly Description Language) was an early solid modeling system developedat the University of Rochester in New York in the late 70's and early 80's.&nbsp;PADL-1 was used strictly as the basis for a prototype solid modeler basedon the Unigraphics user interface which was used to gain experience insolid modeling and to elicit commentary from customers and industry experts.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>The above model was actually created as part of a Unigraphicsbenchmark in 1982.&nbsp; While the benchmark did not require the use ofa solid modeler (which was understandable since there were NO usable commercialsolid modelers available at the time) but it was demoed in order to gagecustomer reaction.&nbsp; Note that using Unigraphics I this model, using3D surface and wireframe techniques, took approximately 25 minutes to create(which was the best time among the systems that were benchmarked).&nbsp;Using the PADL-1 based prototype system, the above model was created anddisplayed as shown in something under 1 minute and 30 seconds (grantedwe had a week to practice for the benchmark, but then so did the AE demoingUnigraphics).&nbsp; In fact the customer did not believe that we did itfrom scratch (we were accused of retrieving an existing model) and we hadto model it twice more, going step by step, before they fully understoodwhat they had just seen.&nbsp; Needless to say, Unigraphics won the benchmarkand also got the contract.</font></b><center><hr WIDTH="100%"><p><b><font size=+2>PADL-1 Model (circa 1982)</font></b><br><img SRC="PADL_model_2_a.jpg" VSPACE=5 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=478 width=648></center><p><b><font size=+1>The image above shows a simple PADL-1 model with sectionviews and section arrows automatically generated by the software.</font></b><center><img SRC="PADL_model_2_b.jpg" VSPACE=5 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=478 width=648></center><p><b><font size=+1>This is the same model, only this time the softwarehas automatically generated the dimensions in the orthographic views.&nbsp;Note that while these "drafting" features were part of the original PADL-1code, they were never reimplemented in the PADL-2 code which was the commercialversion (UniSolids was based on PADL-2).&nbsp;

Note that Unigraphics won theoverall benchmark, but lost the contract to a competitor who did not participatein the original benchmark (it was a bit of a political thing).&nbsp; Yearslater the competitor fell on hard times and had to dispose of the MCADportion of their business, which ironically was acquired by Unigraphics(by then that original customer had moved on to another system and so thesales cycle on this deal is still incomplete).&nbsp; However, this wasthe most successful loss in the history of Unigraphics.&nbsp; You see,years later one of the managers from this customer, who had been a supporterof Unigraphics, left the company and joined EDS where he found himselfin a position to influence GM to the extent that they took a serious lookat Unigraphics, something that was not part of their original plans.&nbsp;That manager later joined the Unigraphics team, after it became part ofEDS, and has since moved up to the highest levels of Unigraphics management.&nbsp;So the moral of the story is, always treat your customer with respect andprofessionalism, even if you lose the contract.&nbsp;
