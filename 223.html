<blockquote><strong>The 24th Annual Unigraphics Users Group Meeting is held in Newport Beach, CA.&nbsp; Attendees from over 300 companies and organizations were at this meeting making it one of the most well represented meetings ever.&nbsp; One of the highlights was the UG version of the "Hollywood Squares" where meeting attendees got a chance to test their knowledge of Unigraphics and it's history (too bad the Virtual Museum was not around then as it would have proved a good source for questions).</strong></blockquote>
<strong>June, 2000:</strong>
<blockquote><strong>Unigraphics Solutions and General Motors Corp. sign the largest single contract for CAD/CAE/CAM/PDM software and services in the history of the industry.&nbsp; This was a renewal of the original contract signed while Unigraphics was still part of the EDS organization.&nbsp; The value of the contract was over $139 million and covered a period of three years and involved virtually all GM's worldwide automotive operations.</strong></blockquote>

<p><strong>Unigraphics Solutions completes the acquisition of Engineering Animation Inc. (EAI) of Ames, IA.&nbsp; EAI products include the line e-Vis and Vis-View software as well as many products designed for use on the internet.&nbsp; EAI had been a longtime partner with Unigraphics Solutions supplying tools used in ProductVision as well as being a licensee of Parasolid that they had incorporated into their products.</strong></p>

<blockquote><img title="ugs_logo[1].gif" src="./images/dwwnzfdv.gif" alt="ugs_logo[1].gif" width="170" height="75" border="0" /><strong>Due to the changes in the makeup of the company through the growth of other product lines and the recent acquisitions, Unigraphics Solutions announced that the name of the company was being changed to simply UGS.&nbsp; Even though the Unigraphics product line was still the largest product line in terms of revenue and number of customers, it was felt that it was no longer appropriate that the company name should include the name Unigraphics.&nbsp; While it is obvious that the UGS name still refers back to the Unigraphics heritage of the company, it will still allow more flexibility and will be easier to use as an overall corporate identity.&nbsp; In conjunction with the name change a complete new marketing effort was put in place including new corporate logo's and product promotions.&nbsp; It was also decided that the World Headquarters for UGS would be moved from St. Louis, MO to Cypress, CA.&nbsp; St. Louis would remain the headquarters for the Americas Sales Region and several of the corporate offices will remain there as well as the existing development group currently in St. Louis.</strong></blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>&nbsp;There were over 700 attendees at this meeting making it one of the better represented meetings.&nbsp; Of special interest at this meeting were several intriguing displays including a Jaguar F1 car, a Mossler/Trenne sports car and an Arctic Cat snowmobile.&nbsp; The two keynote presentations, by Jeffrey Harrow from Compaq and Professor Marvin Minsky from MIT, were very interesting and proved all with new views of technology and its role today.&nbsp; However the biggest thing at the meeting was the announcement made by UGS on the last day of the meeting, which is covered in the next paragraph below.</strong>
<p><img title="EDS_UGS_SDRC[1].jpg" src="./images/fkzqmrfb.jpg" alt="EDS_UGS_SDRC[1].jpg" width="180" height="143" border="0" /><strong>On Wednesday evening at the Orlando Users Group Meeting, after the days sessions had ended, the news was released that EDS intended to take UGS private and to also purchase all of the assets of SDRC (Structural Dynamics Research Corp.) of Milford, OH.&nbsp; SDRC is one of the oldest and most well respected CAD/CAE/CAM/PDM companies in the industry and a pioneer in enterprise level data management, among other technologies.&nbsp; EDS intends on building a new business unit around these two organization, which will continue to be known as UGS and will be operated as an EDS subsidiary.&nbsp; The new company is projected to have sales in excess of $1.2 billion per year, which would make it the dominate supplier in its market segment.&nbsp; The announcement included the statement that the organization would continue to be headquartered in Cypress, CA and Tony Affuso would be appointed President of the new EDS unit.</strong></p>
