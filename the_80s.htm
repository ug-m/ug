Towers in Anaheim, CA.&nbsp; The numberone topic at the meeting was the announcement to drop Data General as ahardware vendor and the impending loss of support for Unigraphics userson DG hardware.&nbsp; This was such a big issue that the Unigraphics managementwas forced to make a commitment to continue full support of not only UnigraphicsII, but also UniSolids and UniPCB.&nbsp; DG users would get enhancementreleases for 5 years and full maintenance and support for 6 years.&nbsp;The only exception to this would be if a product was completely discontinuedearlier than that (which is what happened, first with UniPCB and then withUniSolids).&nbsp; The agreement however did not guarantee that all newproducts or modules would be covered by this agreement, which was a continuouspoint of contention throughout the life of the agreement.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>Also announced at this meeting was the plans by M&amp;Eto add a license management system to Unigraphics II.&nbsp; This system,called the Access Control System (ACS) was to be introduced over time startingwith Unigraphics II V4.1 where the Design/Drafting module would be managedand where additional products and modules would be added in later releases.&nbsp;This meant that all users would have to convert to per seat pricing andmaintenance.&nbsp; Up until this time software was sold using several differentschemes.&nbsp; On mainframes with multiple stations attached, Unigraphicswas broken down into "Large" and "Small" system prices, based on the maximumnumber of terminals that could be hooked up and run at any one time, irrespectiveof whether there were actually that many present or not.&nbsp; On workstationsand single display systems, the software was sold on a per seat basis,but there was no real way to stop a customer from running additional stationsas a remote terminal.&nbsp; With the ACS scheme, really brought about becauseof things like VaxClusters running several VaxStations from a common server,each system would need to check-out a license before a module would bemade available to a logged in user.&nbsp; While it did force some additionalcomplexity for the customers, it did provide them with additional flexibility,and based on a very liberal grand-fathering plan, provided most of ourusers with many more seats of Unigraphics than they really needed and allowedthem to either drop seats, which in many cases meant that they could reducetheir monthly maintenance cost, or to delay the purchase of additionalsoftware due to the fact that they already had additional "licenses inthe bank".&nbsp; This situation was on the mind of the Unigraphics peoplewhen years later there was the need to grand-father customers from V9.0to V10.0.</font></b></blockquote><b><font size=+2>March, 1987:</font></b><blockquote><img SRC="hall/VaxStation_2000_Small.jpg" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 NOSAVE BORDER=0 height=144 width=210 align=RIGHT><br><b><font size=+1>Version 4.1 of Unigraphics II is released.&nbsp;

It was atthis meeting that a proposal was discussed about the need to produce atotally new product to replace Unigraphics.&nbsp; By this time it was generallyacknowledged that a solid geometry based CAD system was highly desirable(remember this was before the acquisition of Shape Data) and that the companyshould begin to explore what it would take to accomplish that.&nbsp; Basedon previous history, most people who walked into this meeting assumed thatwhat we were really talking about was something that could be called UGIIIhowever that did not sit well with the head of development, Bob Loss.&nbsp;It seems Bob had a strong aversion to naming this future product UGIII(you see at that time there was this feeling that products which carrieda designation of "3" never quite turned out as well number "2" did, forexample, look at how well the Apple III did).&nbsp; Anyway, Bob refusedto let anyone use the word UGIII during the meeting since he was convincedthat if we left the meeting with that name on our lips, that we would neverbe able to stop using it.&nbsp; So in order to avoid saying that "name"during the discussions that took place, the participants resorted to theuse of a nonsense word, in this case "Kleenex Box" (there was one sittingin the middle of the conference room table) whenever they needed to saythe "name" of the proposed new product.&nbsp; Well just before the meetingbroke up someone commented that since it was St. Patrick's Day that maybewe could use that as inspiration.&nbsp; So this is how the "<i><a href="archive/Archive_Misc.htm#shamrock_pres">ShamrockProject</a></i>" got its name.</font></b><p><b><font size=+1>Note however that while the Shamrock Project was originallyintended to result in a totally new product, many factors became apparentover time which forced the company to slowly modify that vision to onewhere it was decided rather then pursuing a "revolutionary" process, thatit would be more of a "radical evolution" of the existing Unigraphics IIproduct.&nbsp; So while the original vision of that meeting was never realized,it started a series of events and activities that eventually lead to thedevelopment of Unigraphics V10.0.&nbsp; Remember that many forces wereto come to play over the next several years, including the changing fortunesof McDonnell Douglas, the acquisition of Shape Data Ltd and the technology,as well as the ideas and vision of their people, that was now available,winning the GM business and the impact that their requirements suddenlyhad on the long term plans and then all of this coming to together withthe sale of the Unigraphics organization to EDS in 1991.&nbsp;
